    "# Dataset\n",
    "The dataset used in this vignette is from the paper [Large-scale integration of single-cell transcriptomic data captures transitional progenitor states in mouse skeletal muscle regeneration](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-02810-x) [@McKellar2021-ek]. Notexin was injected into the tibialis anterior muscle of mice to induce injury, and the healing muscle was collected 2, 5, and 7 days post injury for Visium analysis. The dataset in this vignette is from the timepoint at day 2. The vignette starts with a `SpatialFeatureExperiment` (SFE) object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gene count matrix was directly downloaded [from GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM4904759). All 4992 spots, whether in tissue or not, are included. The H&E image was used for nuclei and myofiber segmentation. A subset of nuclei from randomly selected regions from all 3 timepoints were manually annotated to train a StarDist model to segment the rest of the nuclei, and the myofibers were all manually segmented. The tissue boundary was found by thresholding in OpenCV, and small polygons were removed as they are likely to be debris. Spot polygons were constructed with the spot centroid coordinates and diameter in the Space Ranger output. The `in_tissue` column in `colData` indicates which spot polygons intersect the tissue polygons, and is based on `st_intersects()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tissue boundary, nuclei, myofiber, and Visium spot polygons are stored as `sf` data frames in the SFE object. See [the vignette of `SpatialFeatureExperiment`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/SpatialFeatureExperiment/inst/doc/SFE.html) for more details on the structure of the SFE object. The SFE object of this dataset is provided in the `SFEData` package; we begin by downloading the data and loading it into R."

    "Total UMI counts (`nCounts`), number of genes detected per spot (`nGenes`), and the proportion of mitochondrially encoded counts (`prop_mito`) have been precomputed and are in `colData(sfe)`. The `plotSpatialFeature` function can be used to visualize various attributes in space: the expression of any gene, `colData` values, and geometry attributes in `colGeometry` and `annotGeometry`. The Visium spots are plotted as polygons reflecting their actual size relative to the tissue, rather than as points, as is the case in other packages that plot Visium data. The plotting of geometries is being performed under the hood with `geom_sf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tissue boundary was found by thresholding the H&E image and removing small polygons that are most likely debris. The `in_tissue` column of `colData(sfe)` indicates which Visium spot polygon intersects the tissue polygon; this can be found with `SpatialFeatureExperiment::annotPred()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate the use of `scran` [@Lun2016-yq] for normalization below, although we note that it is not necessarily the best approach to normalizing spatial transcriptomics data. The problem of when and how to normalize spatial transcriptomics data is non-trivial because, as the `nCounts` plot in space shows above, spatial autocorrelation is evident. Furthemrore, in Visium, reverse transcription occurs in situ on the spots, but PCR amplification occurs after the cDNA is dissociated from the spots. Artifacts may be subsequently introduced from the amplification step, and these would not be associated with spatial origin. Spatial artifacts may arise from the diffusion of transcripts and tissue permeablization. However, given how the total counts seem to correspond to histological regions, the total counts may have a biological component and hence should not be treated as a technical artifact to be normalized away as in scRNA-seq data normalization methods. In other words, the issue of normalization for spatial transcriptomics data, and Visium in particular, is complex and is currently unsolved. "

    "The `plotSpatialFeature()` function can also be used to plot attributes of geometries, i.e. the non-geometry columns in the `sf` data frames in the `rowGeometries`, `colGeometries`, or `annotGeometries` fields of the SFE object. For `rowGeometries` and `colGeometries`, such columns which are associated with the `sf` data frames rather than `rowData` or `colData`, are allowed because one can specify how these columns associate with the geometries (see [`st_agr`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/st_agr.html) and [documentation of `st_sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/sf.html#details-1)). When an attribute of an `annotGeometry` is plotted along side gene expression or `colData` or `colGeometry` attribute, the `annotGeometry` attribute is plotted with a different color palette to distinguish it from the column associated values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The myofiber polygons from `annotGeometries` can be plotted as shown below, colored by cross section area as observed in the tissue section. The `aes_use` argument is set to `color` rather than `fill` (default for polygons) to only plot the Visium spot outlines to make the myofiber polygons more visible. The `fill` argument is set to `NA` to make the Visium spots look hollow, and the `size` argument controls the thickness of the outlines. The `annot_aes` argument specifies which column in the `annotGeometry` to use to specify the values of an aesthstic, just like `aes` in `ggplot2` (`aes_string` to be precise, since `tidyeval` is not used here). The `annot_fixed` argument (not used here) can set the fixed size, alpha, color, and etc. for the `annotGeometry`. "

    "We first examine the Type I myofibers. This is a fast twitch muscle, so we don't expect many slow twitch Type I myofibers. Row names in `sfe_tissue` are Ensembl IDs in order to avoid ambiguity as sometimes multiple Ensembl IDs have the same gene symbol and some genes have aliases. However, gene symbols are shorter and more human readable than Ensembl IDs, and are better suited to display on plots.  In the `plotSpatialFeature()` function and other functions in `Voyager`, even when the row names are recorded as Ensembl IDs, the `features` argument can take gene symbols if there is a column called \"symbols\" in `rowData(sfe)`, where the function converts the gene symbols to Ensembl IDs. By default, gene symbols are shown on the plot, but the `show_symbol` argument can be set to `FALSE` to show Ensembl IDs instead. If one gene symbol matches multiple Ensembl IDs in the dataset, then a warning will be given.\n",

    "# Spatial neighborhood graphs\n",
    "A spatial neighborhood graph is required to compute spatial dependency metrics such as Moran's I and Geary's C. The `SpatialFeatureExperiment` package wraps methods in `spdep` to find spatial neighborhood graphs, which are stored within the SFE object (see `spdep` documentation for `gabrielneigh()`, `knearneigh()`, `poly2nb()`, and `tri2nb()`). The `Voyager` package then uses these graphs for spatial dependency analyses, again based on `spdep` in this first version, but methods from other geospatial packages, some of which also use the spatial neighborhood graphs, may be added later.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Visium, where the spots are in a hexagonal grid, the spatial neighborhood graph is straightforward. However, for spatial technologies with single cell resolution, e.g. MERFISH, different methods can be used to find the spatial neighborhood graph. In this example, the method \"poly2nb\" was used for myofibers, and it identifies myofiber polygons that physically touch each other. `zero.policy = TRUE` will allow for singletons, i.e. nodes without neighbors in the graph; in the inflamed region, there are more singletons. We have not yet benchmarked spatial neighborhood construction methods to determine which is the \"best\" for different technologies; the particular method used here is for demonstration purposes and may not be the best in practice: "

The user interface emulates those of dimension reductions in the `scater` package (e.g. `calculateUMAP()` that takes in a matrix or SCE object and returns a matrix, and `runUMAP()` that takes in an SCE object and adds the results to the `reducedDims` field of the SCE object). So `calculate*` functions take in a matrix or an SFE object and directly return the results (format of the results depends on the structure of the results), while `run*` functions take in an SFE object and add the results to the object. In addition, `colData*` functions compute the metrics for numeric variables in `colData`. `colGeometry*` functions compute the metrics for numeric columns in a `colGeometry`. `annotGeometry*` functions compute the metrics for numeric columns in a `annotGeometry`. \n",

In addition, beyond `spdep`, `Voyager` can cluster Moran plots and correlograms. Plotting functions taking in SFE objects are implemented to plot the results with `ggplot2` and with more customization options than `spdep` plotting functions. The functions `calculateUnivariate()`, `runUnivariate()`, `colDataUnivariate()`, `colGeometryUnivariate()`, and `annotGeometryUnivariate()` compute univariate spatial statistics. The argument `type`, which indicates the corresponding function names in `spdep`, determines which spatial statistics are computed. \n",

    "## Getis-Ord Gi\\*\n",
    "Getis-Ord Gi\\* is used to find hotspots and coldspots of a feature in space. A hotspot is a cluster of high values in space, and a coldspot is a cluster of low values in space. Getis-Ord Gi\\* is essentially the z-score of the spatially lagged value of the feature at each location $i$ ($\\sum_j w_{ij}x_j $), where $w_{ij}$ is the spatial weight. In the [original publication for Getis-Ord Gi\\* from 1992](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1992.tb00261.x) [@Getis1992-fr], the spatial weight is a distance-based binary weight indicating whether another location is within a certain distance from each location $i$. Getis-Ord Gi excludes the location $i$ itself in the computation of mean and variance of the lagged value, while Gi\\* includes the location $i$ itself. Usually Gi and Gi\\* yield similar results. The mean and variance used in the z-score differ in Gi and Gi\\* and is described in [this paper from 1995](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00912.x) [@Ord1995-we] and derived in [@Getis1992-fr].\n",

    "1. In the current version of `Voyager`, only univariate spatial autocorrelation metrics are supported. Anisotropy, bivariate, and multivariate spatial analyses will be added in later versions.\n",
    "2. The H&E image can alter perception of the colors of the geometries.\n",
    "3. Only 2D data is supported at present, although in principle, `sf` and `GEOS` support 3D data.\n",
    "4. Spatial neighborhoods only make sense within the same tissue section. Then what to do with multiple tissue sections, from biological replica, and from different conditions? For the mouse brain, different biological replica can be registered to the Allen Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) to be spatially comparable. Indeed, it would be interesting to see the biological variability of healthy wild type gene expression at the same fine scaled region in the brain. However, there is no CCF for tissues without a stereotypical structure, such as adipose and skeletal muscle. We don't have a good solution to spatially compare different tissue sections yet. Perhaps global spatial statistics over the whole section or histological regions within the section can be compared. The problem remains to select the most informative metrics to compare. Perhaps a spatially-informed dimension reduction method, taking not only the gene count matrix, but also the adjacency matrices of the spatial neighborhood graphs (different sections will be different blocks in the matrix) projecting the cells or Visium spots from different sections into a shared low dimensional space can facilitate the comparison. Here batch effect must be corrected, and the dimension reduction should be interpretable, and scalable.\n",

Notexin was injected into the tibialis anterior muscle of mice to induce injury, and the healing muscle was collected 2, 5, and 7 days post injury for Visium analysis.

The H&E image was used for nuclei and myofiber segmentation. A subset of nuclei from randomly selected regions from all 3 timepoints were manually annotated to train a StarDist model to segment the rest of the nuclei, and the myofibers were all manually segmented. The tissue boundary was found by thresholding in OpenCV, and small polygons were removed as they are likely to be debris.

The `in_tissue` column in `colData` indicates which spot polygons intersect the tissue polygons, and is based on `st_intersects()`.\n",

Furthemrore, in Visium, reverse transcription occurs in situ on the spots, but PCR amplification occurs after the cDNA is dissociated from the spots. Artifacts may be subsequently introduced from the amplification step, and these would not be associated with spatial origin. Spatial artifacts may arise from the diffusion of transcripts and tissue permeablization. However, given how the total counts seem to correspond to histological regions, the total counts may have a biological component and hence should not be treated as a technical artifact to be normalized away as in scRNA-seq data normalization methods. In other words, the issue of normalization for spatial transcriptomics data, and Visium in particular, is complex and is currently unsolved. "

    "## Getis-Ord Gi\\*\n",
    "Getis-Ord Gi\\* is used to find hotspots and coldspots of a feature in space. A hotspot is a cluster of high values in space, and a coldspot is a cluster of low values in space. Getis-Ord Gi\\* is essentially the z-score of the spatially lagged value of the feature at each location $i$ ($\\sum_j w_{ij}x_j $), where $w_{ij}$ is the spatial weight. In the [original publication for Getis-Ord Gi\\* from 1992](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1992.tb00261.x) [@Getis1992-fr], the spatial weight is a distance-based binary weight indicating whether another location is within a certain distance from each location $i$. Getis-Ord Gi excludes the location $i$ itself in the computation of mean and variance of the lagged value, while Gi\\* includes the location $i$ itself. Usually Gi and Gi\\* yield similar results. The mean and variance used in the z-score differ in Gi and Gi\\* and is described in [this paper from 1995](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00912.x) [@Ord1995-we] and derived in [@Getis1992-fr].\n",

    "1. In the current version of `Voyager`, only univariate spatial autocorrelation metrics are supported. Anisotropy, bivariate, and multivariate spatial analyses will be added in later versions.\n",
    "2. The H&E image can alter perception of the colors of the geometries.\n",
    "3. Only 2D data is supported at present, although in principle, `sf` and `GEOS` support 3D data.\n",
    "4. Spatial neighborhoods only make sense within the same tissue section. Then what to do with multiple tissue sections, from biological replica, and from different conditions? For the mouse brain, different biological replica can be registered to the Allen Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) to be spatially comparable. Indeed, it would be interesting to see the biological variability of healthy wild type gene expression at the same fine scaled region in the brain. However, there is no CCF for tissues without a stereotypical structure, such as adipose and skeletal muscle. We don't have a good solution to spatially compare different tissue sections yet. Perhaps global spatial statistics over the whole section or histological regions within the section can be compared. The problem remains to select the most informative metrics to compare. Perhaps a spatially-informed dimension reduction method, taking not only the gene count matrix, but also the adjacency matrices of the spatial neighborhood graphs (different sections will be different blocks in the matrix) projecting the cells or Visium spots from different sections into a shared low dimensional space can facilitate the comparison. Here batch effect must be corrected, and the dimension reduction should be interpretable, and scalable.\n",

A subset of nuclei from randomly selected regions from all 3 timepoints were manually annotated to train a StarDist model to segment the rest of the nuclei, and the myofibers were all manually segmented.

The Visium spots are plotted as polygons reflecting their actual size relative to the tissue, rather than as points, as is the case in other packages that plot Visium data. The plotting of geometries is being performed under the hood with `geom_sf`.\n",

    "We demonstrate the use of `scran` [@Lun2016-yq] for normalization below, although we note that it is not necessarily the best approach to normalizing spatial transcriptomics data. The problem of when and how to normalize spatial transcriptomics data is non-trivial because, as the `nCounts` plot in space shows above, spatial autocorrelation is evident. Furthemrore, in Visium, reverse transcription occurs in situ on the spots, but PCR amplification occurs after the cDNA is dissociated from the spots. Artifacts may be subsequently introduced from the amplification step, and these would not be associated with spatial origin. Spatial artifacts may arise from the diffusion of transcripts and tissue permeablization. However, given how the total counts seem to correspond to histological regions, the total counts may have a biological component and hence should not be treated as a technical artifact to be normalized away as in scRNA-seq data normalization methods. In other words, the issue of normalization for spatial transcriptomics data, and Visium in particular, is complex and is currently unsolved. "

    "## Getis-Ord Gi\\*\n",
    "Getis-Ord Gi\\* is used to find hotspots and coldspots of a feature in space. A hotspot is a cluster of high values in space, and a coldspot is a cluster of low values in space. Getis-Ord Gi\\* is essentially the z-score of the spatially lagged value of the feature at each location $i$ ($\\sum_j w_{ij}x_j $), where $w_{ij}$ is the spatial weight. In the [original publication for Getis-Ord Gi\\* from 1992](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1992.tb00261.x) [@Getis1992-fr], the spatial weight is a distance-based binary weight indicating whether another location is within a certain distance from each location $i$. Getis-Ord Gi excludes the location $i$ itself in the computation of mean and variance of the lagged value, while Gi\\* includes the location $i$ itself. Usually Gi and Gi\\* yield similar results. The mean and variance used in the z-score differ in Gi and Gi\\* and is described in [this paper from 1995](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00912.x) [@Ord1995-we] and derived in [@Getis1992-fr].\n",

    "3. Only 2D data is supported at present, although in principle, `sf` and `GEOS` support 3D data.\n",
    "4. Spatial neighborhoods only make sense within the same tissue section. Then what to do with multiple tissue sections, from biological replica, and from different conditions? For the mouse brain, different biological replica can be registered to the Allen Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) to be spatially comparable. Indeed, it would be interesting to see the biological variability of healthy wild type gene expression at the same fine scaled region in the brain. However, there is no CCF for tissues without a stereotypical structure, such as adipose and skeletal muscle. We don't have a good solution to spatially compare different tissue sections yet. Perhaps global spatial statistics over the whole section or histological regions within the section can be compared. The problem remains to select the most informative metrics to compare. Perhaps a spatially-informed dimension reduction method, taking not only the gene count matrix, but also the adjacency matrices of the spatial neighborhood graphs (different sections will be different blocks in the matrix) projecting the cells or Visium spots from different sections into a shared low dimensional space can facilitate the comparison. Here batch effect must be corrected, and the dimension reduction should be interpretable, and scalable.\n",

Notexin was injected into the tibialis anterior muscle of mice to induce injury, and the healing muscle was collected 2, 5, and 7 days post injury for Visium analysis.

The H&E image was used for nuclei and myofiber segmentation. A subset of nuclei from randomly selected regions from all 3 timepoints were manually annotated to train a StarDist model to segment the rest of the nuclei, and the myofibers were all manually segmented. The tissue boundary was found by thresholding in OpenCV, and small polygons were removed as they are likely to be debris. Spot polygons were constructed with the spot centroid coordinates and diameter in the Space Ranger output. The `in_tissue` column in `colData` indicates which spot polygons intersect the tissue polygons, and is based on `st_intersects()`.\n",

Furthemrore, in Visium, reverse transcription occurs in situ on the spots, but PCR amplification occurs after the cDNA is dissociated from the spots. Artifacts may be subsequently introduced from the amplification step, and these would not be associated with spatial origin. Spatial artifacts may arise from the diffusion of transcripts and tissue permeablization. However, given how the total counts seem to correspond to histological regions, the total counts may have a biological component and hence should not be treated as a technical artifact to be normalized away as in scRNA-seq data normalization methods. In other words, the issue of normalization for spatial transcriptomics data, and Visium in particular, is complex and is currently unsolved. "

The `Voyager` package then uses these graphs for spatial dependency analyses, again based on `spdep` in this first version, but methods from other geospatial packages, some of which also use the spatial neighborhood graphs, may be added later.\n",

However, for spatial technologies with single cell resolution, e.g. MERFISH, different methods can be used to find the spatial neighborhood graph. In this example, the method \"poly2nb\" was used for myofibers, and it identifies myofiber polygons that physically touch each other. `zero.policy = TRUE` will allow for singletons, i.e. nodes without neighbors in the graph; in the inflamed region, there are more singletons. We have not yet benchmarked spatial neighborhood construction methods to determine which is the \"best\" for different technologies; the particular method used here is for demonstration purposes and may not be the best in practice: "

So `calculate*` functions take in a matrix or an SFE object and directly return the results (format of the results depends on the structure of the results), while `run*` functions take in an SFE object and add the results to the object.

At each lag the error bars are tight (see next paragraph in the main text) and the p-values are less than 0.001 after Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction over the 2 genes and 10 lags."

    "Getis-Ord Gi\\* is used to find hotspots and coldspots of a feature in space. A hotspot is a cluster of high values in space, and a coldspot is a cluster of low values in space. Getis-Ord Gi\\* is essentially the z-score of the spatially lagged value of the feature at each location $i$ ($\\sum_j w_{ij}x_j $), where $w_{ij}$ is the spatial weight. In the [original publication for Getis-Ord Gi\\* from 1992](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1992.tb00261.x) [@Getis1992-fr], the spatial weight is a distance-based binary weight indicating whether another location is within a certain distance from each location $i$. Getis-Ord Gi excludes the location $i$ itself in the computation of mean and variance of the lagged value, while Gi\\* includes the location $i$ itself. Usually Gi and Gi\\* yield similar results. The mean and variance used in the z-score differ in Gi and Gi\\* and is described in [this paper from 1995](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00912.x) [@Ord1995-we] and derived in [@Getis1992-fr].\n",

    "1. In the current version of `Voyager`, only univariate spatial autocorrelation metrics are supported. Anisotropy, bivariate, and multivariate spatial analyses will be added in later versions.\n",
    "2. The H&E image can alter perception of the colors of the geometries.\n",
    "3. Only 2D data is supported at present, although in principle, `sf` and `GEOS` support 3D data.\n",
    "4. Spatial neighborhoods only make sense within the same tissue section. Then what to do with multiple tissue sections, from biological replica, and from different conditions? For the mouse brain, different biological replica can be registered to the Allen Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) to be spatially comparable. Indeed, it would be interesting to see the biological variability of healthy wild type gene expression at the same fine scaled region in the brain. However, there is no CCF for tissues without a stereotypical structure, such as adipose and skeletal muscle. We don't have a good solution to spatially compare different tissue sections yet. Perhaps global spatial statistics over the whole section or histological regions within the section can be compared. The problem remains to select the most informative metrics to compare. Perhaps a spatially-informed dimension reduction method, taking not only the gene count matrix, but also the adjacency matrices of the spatial neighborhood graphs (different sections will be different blocks in the matrix) projecting the cells or Visium spots from different sections into a shared low dimensional space can facilitate the comparison. Here batch effect must be corrected, and the dimension reduction should be interpretable, and scalable.\n",

Notexin was injected into the tibialis anterior muscle of mice to induce injury, and the healing muscle was collected 2, 5, and 7 days post injury for Visium analysis.

The H&E image was used for nuclei and myofiber segmentation. A subset of nuclei from randomly selected regions from all 3 timepoints were manually annotated to train a StarDist model to segment the rest of the nuclei, and the myofibers were all manually segmented. The tissue boundary was found by thresholding in OpenCV, and small polygons were removed as they are likely to be debris. Spot polygons were constructed with the spot centroid coordinates and diameter in the Space Ranger output. The `in_tissue` column in `colData` indicates which spot polygons intersect the tissue polygons, and is based on `st_intersects()`.\n",

Furthemrore, in Visium, reverse transcription occurs in situ on the spots, but PCR amplification occurs after the cDNA is dissociated from the spots. Artifacts may be subsequently introduced from the amplification step, and these would not be associated with spatial origin. Spatial artifacts may arise from the diffusion of transcripts and tissue permeablization. However, given how the total counts seem to correspond to histological regions, the total counts may have a biological component and hence should not be treated as a technical artifact to be normalized away as in scRNA-seq data normalization methods. In other words, the issue of normalization for spatial transcriptomics data, and Visium in particular, is complex and is currently unsolved. "

So `calculate*` functions take in a matrix or an SFE object and directly return the results (format of the results depends on the structure of the results), while `run*` functions take in an SFE object and add the results to the object.

    "Getis-Ord Gi\\* is used to find hotspots and coldspots of a feature in space. A hotspot is a cluster of high values in space, and a coldspot is a cluster of low values in space. Getis-Ord Gi\\* is essentially the z-score of the spatially lagged value of the feature at each location $i$ ($\\sum_j w_{ij} x_j$), where $w_{ij}$ is the spatial weight. In the [original publication for Getis-Ord Gi\\* from 1992](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1992.tb00261.x) [@Getis1992-fr], the spatial weight is a distance-based binary weight indicating whether another location is within a certain distance from each location $i$. Getis-Ord Gi excludes the location $i$ itself in the computation of mean and variance of the lagged value, while Gi\\* includes the location $i$ itself. Usually Gi and Gi\\* yield similar results. The mean and variance used in the z-score differ in Gi and Gi\\* and is described in [this paper from 1995](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00912.x) [@Ord1995-we] and derived in [@Getis1992-fr].\n",

    "1. In the current version of `Voyager`, only univariate spatial autocorrelation metrics are supported. Anisotropy, bivariate, and multivariate spatial analyses will be added in later versions.\n",
    "2. The H&E image can alter perception of the colors of the geometries.\n",
    "3. Only 2D data is supported at present, although in principle, `sf` and `GEOS` support 3D data.\n",
    "4. Spatial neighborhoods only make sense within the same tissue section. Then what to do with multiple tissue sections, from biological replica, and from different conditions? For the mouse brain, different biological replica can be registered to the Allen Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) to be spatially comparable. Indeed, it would be interesting to see the biological variability of healthy wild type gene expression at the same fine scaled region in the brain. However, there is no CCF for tissues without a stereotypical structure, such as adipose and skeletal muscle. We don't have a good solution to spatially compare different tissue sections yet. Perhaps global spatial statistics over the whole section or histological regions within the section can be compared. The problem remains to select the most informative metrics to compare. Perhaps a spatially-informed dimension reduction method, taking not only the gene count matrix, but also the adjacency matrices of the spatial neighborhood graphs (different sections will be different blocks in the matrix) projecting the cells or Visium spots from different sections into a shared low dimensional space can facilitate the comparison. Here batch effect must be corrected, and the dimension reduction should be interpretable, and scalable.\n",
