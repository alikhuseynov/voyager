    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SpatialFeatureExperiment` (SFE) and `Voyager` packages were originally developed around a relatively small Visium dataset as a proof of concept, and were hence not originally optimized for very large datasets. However, larger smFISH datasets with hundreds of thousands, sometimes over a million cells have already been produced and will soon be produced routinely. Among studies using smFISH-based spatial transcriptomics technologies that reported the number of cells per dataset, the number of cells per dataset has increased in the past years [@Moses2022-xz].\n",
    "![alt](https://pachterlab.github.io/LP_2021/05-current-techs_files/figure-html/smfish-lm-cell-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In anticipation of large datasets, this vignette was produced using limited GitHub Actions resources (MacOS), which are 14 GB of RAM with 3 CPU cores and 14 GB of disk space, comparable to laptops. We therefore expect that the analyses in this vignette should scale to reasonably sized datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we use in this vignette is a MERFISH mouse liver dataset downloaded from the [Vizgen website](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/vz-liver-showcase/Liver1Slice1). We will use it to discuss some issues with large datasets and some upcoming features in the next release of `Voyager`. The gene count matrix and cell metadata (including centroid coordinates) were downloaded as CSV files and read into R. While 7 z-planes were imaged, cell segmentation is only available in one z-plane. The cell polygons are in HDF5 files, with one HDF5 file per field of view (FOV), and there are over 1000 FOVs in this dataset. Converting these HDF5 files into an `sf` data frame is not trivial. See the [vignette on creating a `SpatialFeatureExperiment` (SFE) object](https://pachterlab.github.io/voyager/articles/create_sfe.html#technology-specific-notes) for code used to do the conversion, and the polygons are included in the SFE object. The cell metadata already has cell volume. If the polygons are not used in the analyses, and the polygons can't be seen on a static plot with hundreds of thousands of cells anyway, then doing the conversion is optional. While the transcript spot locations are available, we cannot yet work with such a large point dataset.\n",

The output from `findKNN()` contains a matrix for the indices of the neighbors, and another matrix for the distances to the neighbors. To further speed up the code, we directly compute the inverse distance edge weights without using `nb2listwdist()` and format the data into the `listw` structure.

This is not necessarily due to Annoy by itself being faster than the kd tree method in `dbscan`, which is also used by `spdep`. While dbscan returns a distance matrix after computing k nearest neighbors, spdep does not keep the distance matrix. As a result, in spdep , when the distances are needed to compute edge weights, much of the time was spent in `nb2listwdist()` to compute the distance based edge weights from the geometry. Here we kept and used the distance matrix from `BiocNeighbors::findKNN()`, skipping the time consuming step of finding the distance again from the geometry.

This is only for nCounts, and may differ for other QC metrics and genes. What if anisotropy varies in space? A problem with the variogram is that it's global, giving one result for the entire dataset, albeit more nuanced than just a number as in Moran's I, because kriging assumes that the data is intrinsically stationary, meaning that the same variogram model applies everywhere, and that spatial dependence only depends on lag between two observations.\n",

    "# PCA for larger datasets\n",

According to [this benchmark](https://slowkow.com/notes/pca-benchmark/), `stats::prcomp()` shipped with R is rather slow for larger datasets. The fastest methods are `irlba::irlba()` and `RSpectra::svds()`, and the former is supported by `BiocSingular`. So here we use IRLBA and see how long it takes. Many PCA algorithms involve repeated matrix multiplications. R does not come with optimized BLAS and LAPACK, for portability reasons. However, the BLAS and LAPACK used by R can be changed to an optimized one (here's [how to do it](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Shared-BLAS)), which will speed up matrix multiplication.

    "PC1 and PC4 highlight the major blood vessels, while PC2 and PC3 have less spatial structure. While in the CosMX and Xenium datasets on this website, the top PCs have clear spatial structures despite the absence of spatial information in non-spatial PCA because of clear spatial compartments for some cell types, which does not seem to be the case in this dataset except for the blood vessels. We have seen above that some genes have strong spatial structures. There are some methods for spatially informed PCA, such as MULTISPATI PCA [@Dray2008-en] in the [`adespatial`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/adespatial/index.html) package, which seeks to maximize both variance (as in non-spatial PCA) and Moran's I on each PC. Unlike traditional PCs, where all eigenvalues, signifying variance explained, are positive, MULTISPATI PCA can have negative eigenvalues, which signify negative spatial autocorrelation. The PCs from MULTISPATI PCA with positive eigenvalues are also more spatially coherent than those from non-spatial PCA. For the CosMX and Xenium datasets on this website, the spatial coherence from MULTISPATI might not make a difference, but it might make a difference in this dataset where non-spatial PCs don't show as much spatial structure, at least at the larger scale over the entire tissue section. \n",

GWPCA runs PCA at each spatial location using only the nearby locations weighed by a kernel. The different locations can have different PCs, and the results can be visualized with \"winning variables\" in each PC, i.e. plotting which feature has the highest loading in each PC in space.

    "Here, despite the numerous cells, the data was loaded into memory. What if the data doesn't fit into memory? In the next release, we plan to write a new vignette with `DelayedArray` demonstrating out of memory data analysis. This is already supported by `SingleCellExperiment`, which SFE inherits from. However, the geometries, graphs, and local results can take up a lot memory as well. These can possibly be stored in SQL databases and operated on with [`SQLDataFrame`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SQLDataFrame.html). The geometric operations can be handled by [`sedona`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-sedona), although the options are limited compared to GEOS, which performs geometric operations behind the scene for `sf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another question can be raised about large spatial transcriptomics data: Is it still a good idea to analyze the entire dataset at once? There must be many interesting and unique neighborhoods that might not get the attention they deserve when the whole dataset is analyzed at once. After all, in the geographical space, national level data is usually not analyzed at the block resolution, although a reason for this is privacy of the subjects. County resolution is often used, but there aren't hundreds of thousands of counties. Many analyses are done for cities and counties with neighborhood resolution; using the largest geographical unit isn't always the most relevant. Back to histological space: How to aggregate cells into larger spatial units? How to decide which scale of spatial units (analogous to nation vs state vs county and etc) is relevant? We have traditional anatomical ontologies, such as from the Allen Brain Atlas, but this isn't available for all tissues. Also, with more single cell -omics data, the traditional ontologies can be improved.\n",

As we mostly live on the surface of Earth, there are many more 2D geospatial resources than 3D. However, some methods can in principle be applied to 3D and the existing software primarily made for 2D data might work. For example, GEOS supports 3D data, so in principle 3D geometries in `sf` should work, although there's little documentation on this. Also, k nearest neighbor, Moran's I, variograms, and etc. should in principle work in 3D, and `gstat` officially supports 3D. These are more challenges related to 3D data:\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, the geospatial tradition is only one tradition relevant to large spatial data, and at present `Voyager` only works with vector data. We are uncertain whether raster should be added in a later version, and there are existing tools for large raster data as well, such as [TileDB](https://docs.tiledb.com/geospatial/). Other traditions can be relevant, such as astronomy and image processing, but those are beyond the scope of this package.\n",
