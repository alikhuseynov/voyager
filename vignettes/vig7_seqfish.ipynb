    "The data used in this vignette are described in [Integration of spatial and single-cell transcriptomic data elucidates mouse organogenesis](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-01006-2). Briefly, seqFISH was use to profile 351 genes in several mouse embryos at the 8-12 somite stage (ss). We will focus on a single biological replicate, embryo 3. The raw and processed counts and corresponding metadata are available to download from the [Marioni lab](https://content.cruk.cam.ac.uk/jmlab/SpatialMouseAtlas2020/). Expression matrices, segmentation data, and segmented cell vertices are provided as R objects that can be readily imported into an R environment. The data relevant to this vignette have been converted to a `SFE` object and are available to download [here](https://caltech.box.com/public/static/ulrqr1gk7oh21h9ejgua1xajs6dsbvrj) from Box.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data have been added to the `SFEData` package on Bioconductor and will be available in the 3.17 release. \n",

    "We will begin by downloading the data and loading it in to R. "
