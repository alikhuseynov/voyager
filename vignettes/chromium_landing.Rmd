The 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3' v3 solution is a droplet-based single cell sequencing technology that enables gene expression profiling of hundreds to tens of thousands of cells. In a typical protocol, cells are dissociated and captured in Gel Beads-in-emulsion (GEMs). All cDNA from a single cell share the same barcode and additional 10X barcodes help associate individual reads from generated libraries back to the originating GEMs. Though spatial information is lost, the technology has diverse applications, including cell surface protein profiling and assessing the effects of cellular pertubations. 

## Analysis Workflows

The analysis tasks include basic quality control, spatial exploratory data analysis, identification of spatially variable genes, and computation of global and local spatial statistics. Accompanying Colab notebooks are linked when available.
