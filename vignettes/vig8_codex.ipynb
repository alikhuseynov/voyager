    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this vignette is from the paper [Strategies for Accurate Cell Type Identification in CODEX Multiplexed Imaging Data](doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.727626)(Hickey, et.al 2021). The data were collected as part of the HuBMap consortium which seeks to characterize healthy human tissues and make data  broadly available. More specifically, this dataset characterizes 4 regions of the large intestine (colon) from a single donor. This vignette will focus on data from the sigmoid colon. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intestinal sections were interrogated using the multiplexed imaging method CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX). CODEX involves cyclical staining of a tissue with DNA-barcoded antibodies. At each round of experimentation, fluoresently labeled probes hybridize to the tissue bound DNA-conjugated antibodies are subsequently imaged and the stripped from the tissue. At present, the technology quantifies up to 60 markers in a single experiment. Raw images generated from this process are subjected to image stitching, drift compensation, deconvolution, and cycle concatenation using publicly avaialable [software](https://github.com/nolanlab/CODEX). The result of this pre-processing is a matrix that contains the location of individual cells and the quantified markers for each cell. Cell types were assigned as described in the manuscript linked above. Briefly, the authors used a hand-gating strategy to define cell types and create a standard to compare the effect of normalization methods on clustering and cell annotation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The raw intensity data are available for download from HuBMAP with identifier [HBM575.THQMM.284](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/browse/dataset/e6fd525b837f4cf736c8af830f4f750f) and the cell type annotations are provided as supplementary data in the manuscript. The data relevant to this vignette have been converted to a `SFE` object and are available to download [here](https://caltech.box.com/public/static/zfr8l20450n2z28lnp0ugdj471ph9eyx) from Box.  \n",

    "These data will be submitted to the `SFEData` package on Bioconductor and will be available there in a future release. \n",

In the cell below, we demonstrate how to accomplish this using standard matrix operations.

    "The `moranPlot()` function plots spatial data against its spatially lagged values and enables users to assess how similar observed values are to its neighbors. When the variable is centered, the plot is divided into four quadrants defined by the horizontal line y = 0 and the vertical line x = 0. Points in the upper right (or high-high) and lower left (or low-low) quadrants indicate positive spatial association, and points in the lower right (or high-low) and upper left (or low-high) quadrants include observations that exhibit negative spatial association."

    "While Moran's I and other global spatial autocorrelation metrics provide insight to the spatial patterns of gene expression, it is necessarily limited by the structure imposed by the spatial weights matrix. A complimentary task might be to identify spatially variable (SV) genes. One such method to do this is described in [SpatialDE: identification of spatially variable genes](). The method described in the manuscript relies on Gaussian process regression and decomposes variability in expression into spatial and non-spatial components. In contrast to Moran's I, the covariance between each pair of cells is modeled as a function of the distance between them. Notably, it does not require an explicit specification of hte neighborhood graph, but rather the a parameter controls the decay in covariance as distance increases. \n",

    "The `spatialDE` package is implemented in R and requires a normalized matrix as input. The `spatialDE()` function from the package performs normalization steps before running the algorithm. Because the data has already been normalized, we will use the `run()` function directly to run spatialDE. We will first have to convert the centroid coordinates to a data frame as required by the function."

    "Perhaps unsurprisingly, the expression of the top DE genes seems to highlight the spatial distribution of known cell types in the tissue rather than identify spatially restricted gene expression. This is related to the experimental design where the targeted genes were chosen to differentiate cell types. Perhaps in genome-wide technologies, the potential for discovery of neew gene expression patterns is more plausible. There is an open question as to whether these results offer new information compared to what is inferred by typical DE expression methods.  \n",

    "These analyses represent a minority of the types of inferences that can be made from protein expression data. It would be interested to investigate how the protein expression results compare or inform data from spatail scRNA-sequencing experiments. Already, there is work being done to obtain multimodal spatial measurements on the same sample. Importantly however, considerations should be made on the types of biases each individual technology adds to the measurements. These are active areas of research that are ripe for future exploration. \n",
