The Nanostring CosMX Spatial Molecular Imager (SMI) enables spatial profiling of RNA and proteins at cellular or subcellular resolution with formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) or fresh frozen tissue samples. The CosMX technology extends single molecule fluorescent in-situ hybridization (smFISH) by coupling detection probes to a 60-80 nucleotide DNA readout domain. The readout domain contains 4 consecutive regions that hybridize to unique reporters that are read out over sequential imaging rounds. CosMX increases detection efficiency by targeting different regions of the RNA target with up to 5 detection probes, each coupled to the same readout domain. The photocleavable sites in the reporters enable fast fluorescent signal quenching and greatly increase the signal-to-noise ratio. 


## Getting Started

Nanostring has released a CosMX FFPE dataset on their [website](https://nanostring.com/products/cosmx-spatial-molecular-imager/ffpe-dataset/). A tutorial for processing the output of various spatial transcriptomics technologies, including CosMX, into a [`SpatialFeatureExperiment`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/SpatialFeatureExperiment.html)(SFE) object for use with `Voyager` is available on the [Getting Started]() page. 

The vignette linked below provides technology specific notes for data downloaded from Nanostring. Nanostring provides cell segmentation data as images, while cell centroid coordinates are provided as metadata.

## Analysis Workflows

The vignettes below demonstrate workflows that can be implemented with `Voyager` using data generated with the CosMX SMI. The publicly available CosMX dataset profiles 960 genes across 8 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples.
