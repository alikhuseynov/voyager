For the gene count matrix, this can be converted to a matrix and then a sparse `dgCMatrix`. The matrix may need to be transposed so the genes are in rows and cells are in columns. While smFISH based data tend to be less sparse than scRNA-seq data, using sparse matrix is worthwhile since the matrix is still about 50% zero.\n",

The gene count matrix is a `DelayedArray`, so the data is not all loaded into memory and operations on this matrix are performed in chunks. The `DelayedArray` has been converted into a `dgCMatrix` in memory. While the cell metadata is available in the CSV format, there's also the `parquet` format which is more compact on disk, which can be read into R as a data frame with `arrow::read_parquet()`.
