    "### Gene count matrix and cell metadata\n",
    "The gene count matrix and cell metadata (including cell centroid coordinates) from example datasets for technologies such as CosMX and Vizgen are CSV files. We recommend the [`vroom`](https://vroom.r-lib.org/) package to quickly read in large CSV files. The CSV files are read in as data frames. For the gene count matrix, this can be converted to a matrix and then a sparse `dgCMatrix`. The matrix may need to be transposed so the genes are in rows and cells are in columns. While smFISH based data tend to be less sparse than scRNA-seq data, using sparse matrix is worthwhile since the matrix is still about 50% zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Vizgen MERFISH, the first column is cell ID but doesn't have have a column name. The cell IDs are numbers over 30 digits long. If it's read as numbers, its values will change as R doesn't support long integers, so it should instead be read as character. An example to do so: `mat <- vroom(\"Liver1Slice1_cell_by_gene.csv\", col_types = cols(...1 = \"c\"))`, as `...1` is the name `vroom` gives to the first column that doesn't have a column name, and \"c\" specifies type character.\n",

The gene count matrix is a `DelayedArray`, so the data is not all loaded into memory and operations on this matrix are performed in chunks. The `DelayedArray` has been converted into a `dgCMatrix` in memory. While the cell metadata is available in the CSV format, there's also the `parquet` format which is more compact on disk, which can be read into R as a data frame with `arrow::read_parquet()`.
