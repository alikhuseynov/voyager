The seqFISH technology enables in situ profiling of individual molecules such as RNA, DNA, and protein via sequential rounds of fluorescent labeling and imaging ([Lubeck, et. al.](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2892)). The sequential labeling and imaging rounds can identify up to 24,000 unique targets, and recent publications have demonstrated the ability of the technology to robustly detect 10,000 genes in individual cells ([Eng, et. al.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1049-y)). To date, the technolgy has been  with fluorescent probes and imaged multiple rounds over  situ sequencing methods were developed to directly sequence transcripts in tissue sections, but these methods suffer from low detection Include a description of the technology Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

## Analysis Workflows

Include any tech specific notes The analysis tasks include basic quality control, spatial exploratory data analysis, identification of spatially variable genes, and computation of global and local spatial statistics. Accompanying Colab notebooks are linked when available.
