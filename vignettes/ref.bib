              melanoma, invasive ductal carcinoma and ovarian adenocarcinoma.
              Using immunohistochemistry and an in silico dataset constructed
              from scRNA-seq data, we show that BayesSpace resolves tissue
              structure that is not detectable at the original resolution and

              transcripts from multiple cell types. Here, we introduce a
              statistical method, cell type-specific inference of differential

              across cell types of log-linear cell type-specific expression
              functions. C-SIDE's framework applies to many contexts: DE due to
              pathology, anatomical regions, cell-to-cell interactions and
              cellular microenvironment. Furthermore, C-SIDE enables

              and fusion of myogenic stem and progenitor cells. Single-cell
              gene expression analyses of myogenesis have been hampered by the
              poor sampling of rare and transient cell states that are critical
              for muscle repair, and do not inform the spatial context that is
              important for myogenic differentiation. Here, we demonstrate how
              large-scale integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic
              data can overcome these limitations. We created a single-cell
              transcriptomic dataset of mouse skeletal muscle by integration,
              consensus annotation, and analysis of 23 newly collected scRNAseq
              datasets and 88 publicly available single-cell (scRNAseq) and
              single-nucleus (snRNAseq) RNA-sequencing datasets. The resulting
              dataset includes more than 365,000 cells and spans a wide range
              of ages, injury, and repair conditions. Together, these data
              enabled identification of the predominant cell types in skeletal
              muscle, and resolved cell subtypes, including endothelial
              subtypes distinguished by vessel-type of origin, fibro-adipogenic
              progenitors defined by functional roles, and many distinct immune
              populations. The representation of different experimental
              conditions and the depth of transcriptome coverage enabled robust
              profiling of sparsely expressed genes. We built a densely sampled
              transcriptomic model of myogenesis, from stem cell quiescence to
              myofiber maturation, and identified rare, transitional states of
              progenitor commitment and fusion that are poorly represented in
              individual datasets. We performed spatial RNA sequencing of mouse
              muscle at three time points after injury and used the integrated
              dataset as a reference to achieve a high-resolution, local
              deconvolution of cell subtypes. We also used the integrated
              dataset to explore ligand-receptor co-expression patterns and
              identify dynamic cell-cell interactions in muscle injury
