               be used as a measure of spatial association in a number of
               circumstances. The basic statistic is derived, its properties
               are identified, and its advantages explained. Several of the G
               statistics make it possible to evaluate the spatial association
               of a variable within a specified distance of a single point. A
               comparison is made between a general G statistic and Moran's I
               for similar hypothetical and empirical conditions. The empirical
               work includes studies of sudden infant death syndrome by county
               in North Carolina and dwelling unit prices in metropolitan San
               Diego by zip-code districts. Results indicate that G statistics
               should be used in conjunction with I in order to identify
               characteristics of patterns not revealed by the I statistic
               alone and, specifically, the Giand Gi∗ statistics enable us to

              for muscle repair, and do not inform the spatial context that is

              large-scale integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic

              consensus annotation, and analysis of 23 newly collected scRNAseq
              datasets and 88 publicly available single-cell (scRNAseq) and
              single-nucleus (snRNAseq) RNA-sequencing datasets. The resulting
              dataset includes more than 365,000 cells and spans a wide range

              In biology, single-cell expression studies almost always begin
              with reduction to two or three dimensions to produce `all-in-one'
              visuals of the data that are amenable to the human eye, and these
              are subsequently used for qualitative and quantitative analysis
              of cell relationships. However, there is little theoretical
              support for this practice. We examine the theoretical and
              practical implications of low-dimensional embedding of
              single-cell data, and find extensive distortions incurred on the
              global and local properties of biological patterns relative to
              the high-dimensional, ambient space. In lieu of this, we propose
              semi-supervised dimensionality reduction to higher dimension, and

  abstract = "AbstractThe Spatial Molecular Imaging platform (CosMxTM SMI,
              NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA) utilizes high-plex in-situ
              imaging chemistry for both RNA and protein detection. This
              automated instrument provides 1000's of plex, at high sensitivity
              (1 to 2 copies/cell), very low error rate (0.0092 false
              calls/cell) and background (∼0.04 counts/cell). The imaging
              system generates three-dimensional super-resolution localization
              of analytes at ∼2 million cells per sample, four samples per run.
              Cell segmentation is morphology-based using antibodies,
              compatible with FFPE samples. Multiomic data (980 RNAs, 108
              proteins) were measured at subcellular resolution using FFPE
              tissues (non-small cell lung (NSCLC) and breast cancer) and
              allowed identification of over 18 distinct cell types, 10 unique
              tumor microenvironments, and 100 pairwise ligand-receptor
              interactions. Over 800,000 single cells and ∼260 million
              transcripts data are released into the public domain allowing
              extended data analysis by the entire spatial biology research

              across a whole tissue are revolutionizing the resolution of
              molecular states in clinical tissue samples. Commercially
              available methods that characterize either single cell or spatial
              gene expression are currently limited by low sample throughput
              and/or gene plexy, lack of on-instrument analysis, and the
              destruction of histological features and epitopes during the
              workflow. Here, we analyzed large, serial formalin-fixed,
              paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human breast cancer sections using a
              novel FFPE-compatible single cell gene expression workflow
              (Chromium Fixed RNA Profiling; scFFPE-seq), spatial
              transcriptomics (Visium CytAssist), and automated
              microscopy-based in situ technology using a 313-plex gene panel
              (Xenium In Situ). Whole transcriptome profiling of the FFPE
              tissue using scFFPE-seq and Visium facilitated the identification
              of 17 different cell types. Xenium allowed us to spatially
              resolve these cell types and their gene expression profiles with
              single cell resolution. Due to the non-destructive nature of the
              Xenium workflow, we were able to perform H\&E staining and
              immunofluorescence on the same section post-processing which
              allowed us to spatially register protein, histological, and RNA
              data together into a single image. Integration of data from
              Chromium scFFPE-seq, Visium, and Xenium across serial sections
              allowed us to do extensive benchmarking of sensitivity and
              specificity between the technologies. Furthermore, data
              integration inspired the interrogation of three molecularly
              distinct tumor subtypes (low-grade and high-grade ductal
              carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and invasive carcinoma). We used Xenium
              to characterize the cellular composition and differentially
              expressed genes within these subtypes. This analysis allowed us
              to draw biological insights about DCIS progression to
              infiltrating carcinoma, as the myoepithelial layer degrades and
              tumor cells invade the surrounding stroma. Xenium also allowed us
              to further predict the hormone receptor status of tumor subtypes,
              including a small 0.1 mm2 DCIS region that was triple positive
              for ESR1 (estrogen receptor), PGR (progesterone receptor) and
              ERBB2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, a.k.a. HER2)
              RNA. In order to derive whole transcriptome information about
              these cells, we used Xenium data to interpolate the cell
              composition of Visium spots, and leveraged Visium whole
              transcriptome information to discover new biomarkers of breast
              tumor subtypes. We demonstrate that scFFPE-seq, Visium, and
              Xenium independently provide information about molecular
              signatures relevant to understanding cancer heterogeneity.
              However, it is the integration of these technologies that leads
              to even deeper insights, ushering in discoveries that will
              progress oncology research and the development of diagnostics and
              therapeutics. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement All authors are

               significance levels when testing extreme values from the set of
