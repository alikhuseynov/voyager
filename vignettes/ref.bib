              and identifying relevant dimensions in large-scale data analyses.
              In biology, single-cell expression studies almost always begin
              with reduction to two or three dimensions to produce `all-in-one'
              visuals of the data that are amenable to the human eye, and these
              are subsequently used for qualitative and quantitative analysis
              of cell relationships. However, there is little theoretical
              support for this practice. We examine the theoretical and
              practical implications of low-dimensional embedding of
              single-cell data, and find extensive distortions incurred on the
              global and local properties of biological patterns relative to
              the high-dimensional, ambient space. In lieu of this, we propose
              semi-supervised dimensionality reduction to higher dimension, and
              show that such targeted reduction guided by the metadata
              associated with single-cell experiments provides useful latent
              space representations for hypothesis-driven biological discovery.

              novel FFPE-compatible single cell gene expression workflow
              (Chromium Fixed RNA Profiling; scFFPE-seq), spatial

              of 17 different cell types. Xenium allowed us to spatially
              resolve these cell types and their gene expression profiles with

              distinct tumor subtypes (low-grade and high-grade ductal
              carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and invasive carcinoma). We used Xenium
              to characterize the cellular composition and differentially
              expressed genes within these subtypes. This analysis allowed us
              to draw biological insights about DCIS progression to
              infiltrating carcinoma, as the myoepithelial layer degrades and
              tumor cells invade the surrounding stroma. Xenium also allowed us
              to further predict the hormone receptor status of tumor subtypes,
              including a small 0.1 mm2 DCIS region that was triple positive
              for ESR1 (estrogen receptor), PGR (progesterone receptor) and
              ERBB2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, a.k.a. HER2)
              RNA. In order to derive whole transcriptome information about
              these cells, we used Xenium data to interpolate the cell
              composition of Visium spots, and leveraged Visium whole
              transcriptome information to discover new biomarkers of breast
              tumor subtypes. We demonstrate that scFFPE-seq, Visium, and
              Xenium independently provide information about molecular
              signatures relevant to understanding cancer heterogeneity.

              environment of diseased tissue to be explored. While spatial
              analysis techniques have revealed how cell-cell interactions are
              important within the disease pathology, there remains a gap in
              exploring changes in these interactions within the disease
              process. Specifically, there are currently few established
              methods for performing inference on cell type co-localisation
              changes across images, hindering an understanding of how cellular
              environments change with a disease pathology. RESULTS: We have
              developed the spicyR R package to perform inference on changes in
              the spatial co-localisation of cell types across groups of
              images. Application to simulated data demonstrates a high

              However, this is not straightforward for noisy single-cell data
              where many counts are zero. We present a novel approach where
              expression values are summed across pools of cells, and the
              summed values are used for normalization. Pool-based size factors
              are then deconvolved to yield cell-based factors. Our
              deconvolution approach outperforms existing methods for accurate
              normalization of cell-specific biases in simulated data. Similar
              behavior is observed in real data, where deconvolution improves
              the relevance of results of downstream analyses.",

  abstract = "Skeletal muscle repair is driven by the coordinated self-renewal
              and fusion of myogenic stem and progenitor cells. Single-cell
              gene expression analyses of myogenesis have been hampered by the
              poor sampling of rare and transient cell states that are critical
              for muscle repair, and do not inform the spatial context that is
              important for myogenic differentiation. Here, we demonstrate how
              large-scale integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic
              data can overcome these limitations. We created a single-cell
              transcriptomic dataset of mouse skeletal muscle by integration,
              consensus annotation, and analysis of 23 newly collected scRNAseq
              datasets and 88 publicly available single-cell (scRNAseq) and
              single-nucleus (snRNAseq) RNA-sequencing datasets. The resulting
              dataset includes more than 365,000 cells and spans a wide range
              of ages, injury, and repair conditions. Together, these data
              enabled identification of the predominant cell types in skeletal
              muscle, and resolved cell subtypes, including endothelial
              subtypes distinguished by vessel-type of origin, fibro-adipogenic
              progenitors defined by functional roles, and many distinct immune
              populations. The representation of different experimental
              conditions and the depth of transcriptome coverage enabled robust
              profiling of sparsely expressed genes. We built a densely sampled
              transcriptomic model of myogenesis, from stem cell quiescence to
              myofiber maturation, and identified rare, transitional states of
              progenitor commitment and fusion that are poorly represented in
              individual datasets. We performed spatial RNA sequencing of mouse
              muscle at three time points after injury and used the integrated
              dataset as a reference to achieve a high-resolution, local
              deconvolution of cell subtypes. We also used the integrated
              dataset to explore ligand-receptor co-expression patterns and
              identify dynamic cell-cell interactions in muscle injury
              response. We provide a public web tool to enable interactive
              exploration and visualization of the data. Our work supports the

              function. We developed Expansion-Assisted Iterative Fluorescence
              In Situ Hybridization (EASI-FISH) to survey gene expression in
              brain tissue, as well as a turnkey computational pipeline to
              rapidly process large EASI-FISH image datasets. EASI-FISH was
              optimized for thick brain sections (300 $\mu$m) to facilitate
              reconstruction of spatio-molecular domains that generalize across
              brains. Using the EASI-FISH pipeline, we investigated the spatial
              distribution of dozens of molecularly defined cell types in the
              lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), a brain region with poorly
              defined anatomical organization. Mapping cell types in the LHA
              revealed nine spatially and molecularly defined subregions.
              EASI-FISH also facilitates iterative reanalysis of scRNA-seq
              datasets to determine marker-genes that further dissociated
              spatial and morphological heterogeneity. The EASI-FISH pipeline

              current methods do not sufficiently explore the expressiveness of

              performance. Moreover, the current deep learning based methods

              conST can learn low-dimensional embeddings by effectively
              integrating multi-modal SRT data, i . e . gene expression,
              spatial information, and morphology (if applicable). The learned
              embeddings can be then used for various downstream tasks,
              including clustering, trajectory and pseudotime inference,
              cell-to-cell interaction, etc . Extensive experiments in various
              datasets have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and

              improvement in clustering ARI in the commonly used benchmark

  abstract  = "Negative spatial autocorrelation is one of the most neglected
               concepts in quantitative geography, regional science, and
               spatial statistics/econometrics in general. This paper focuses
               on and contributes to the literature in terms of the following
               three reasons why this neglect exists: Existing spatial
               autocorrelation quantification, the popular form of
               georeferenced variables studied, and the presence of both hidden
               negative spatial autocorrelation, and mixtures of positive and
               negative spatial autocorrelation in georeferenced variables.
               This paper also presents details and insights by furnishing
               concrete empirical examples of negative spatial autocorrelation.
               These examples include: Multi-locational chain store market
               areas, the shrinking city of Detroit, Dallas-Fort Worth
               journey-to-work flows, and county crime data. This paper

@ARTICLE{Langfelder2008-fs,
  title    = "{WGCNA}: an {R} package for weighted correlation network analysis",
  author   = "Langfelder, Peter and Horvath, Steve",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in
              bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene
              co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for
              describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray
              samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be
              used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes,
              for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an
              intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to
              external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and
              for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks
              facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used
              to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These
              methods have been successfully applied in various biological
              contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and
              analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation
              network methodology have been described in separate publications,
              there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and
              consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.
              RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive
              collection of R functions for performing various aspects of
              weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes
              functions for network construction, module detection, gene
              selection, calculations of topological properties, data
              simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external
              software. Along with the R package we also present R software
              tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene
              expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be
              applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA
              package provides R functions for weighted correlation network
              analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression
              data. The R package along with its source code and additional
              material are freely available at

  abstract  = "The identification of spatial structures is a key step in
               understanding the ecological processes structuring the
               distribution of organisms. Spatial patterns in species
               distributions result from a combination of several processes
               occuring at different scales: identifying these scales is thus a
               crucial issue. Recent studies have proposed a new family of
               spatial predictors (PCNM: principal coordinates of neighbours
               matrices; MEMs: Moran's eigenvectors maps) that allow for
               modelling of spatial variation on different scales. To assess
               the multi-scale spatial patterns in multivariate data, these
               variables are often used as predictors in constrained ordination
               methods. However, the selection of the appropriate spatial
               predictors is still troublesome, and the identification of the
               main scales of spatial variation remains an open question. This
               paper presents a new statistical tool to tackle this issue: the
               multi-scale pattern analysis (MSPA). This ordination method uses
               MEMs to decompose ecological variability into several spatial
               scales and then summarizes this decomposition using graphical
               representations. A canonical form of MSPA can also be used to
               assess the spatial scales of the species-environment
               relationships. MSPA is compared to constrained ordination using
               simulated data, and illustrated using the famous oribatid mites
               dataset. The method is implemented in the free software R.",
