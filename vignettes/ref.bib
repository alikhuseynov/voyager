  abstract = "Muscle function is determined by its structure and fiber type
              composition. Here we describe a protocol to examine muscle
              histology and myofiber types using hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E)
              and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. H\&E stain nucleus
              in blue and cytoplasm in red, therefore allowing for
              morphological analyses, such as myofiber diameter, the presence
              of degenerated and regenerated myofibers, and adipocytes and
              fibrotic cells. Muscle fibers in adult skeletal muscles of
              rodents are classified into 4 subtypes based on the expression of
              myosin heavy chain proteins: Myh7 (type I fiber), Myh2 (type IIA
              fiber), Myh1 (type IIX fiber), Myh4 (type IIB fiber). A panel of
              monoclonal antibodies can be used to specifically label these
              muscle fiber subtypes. These protocols are commonly used in the
              study of muscle development, growth and regeneration (for
              example: Wang et al., 2015; Nie et al., 2016; Yue et al., 2016;

  abstract = "Skeletal muscle repair is driven by the coordinated self-renewal
              and fusion of myogenic stem and progenitor cells. Single-cell
              gene expression analyses of myogenesis have been hampered by the
              poor sampling of rare and transient cell states that are critical
              for muscle repair, and do not inform the spatial context that is
              important for myogenic differentiation. Here, we demonstrate how
              large-scale integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic
              data can overcome these limitations. We created a single-cell
              transcriptomic dataset of mouse skeletal muscle by integration,
              consensus annotation, and analysis of 23 newly collected scRNAseq
              datasets and 88 publicly available single-cell (scRNAseq) and
              single-nucleus (snRNAseq) RNA-sequencing datasets. The resulting
              dataset includes more than 365,000 cells and spans a wide range
              of ages, injury, and repair conditions. Together, these data
              enabled identification of the predominant cell types in skeletal
              muscle, and resolved cell subtypes, including endothelial
              subtypes distinguished by vessel-type of origin, fibro-adipogenic
              progenitors defined by functional roles, and many distinct immune
              populations. The representation of different experimental
              conditions and the depth of transcriptome coverage enabled robust
              profiling of sparsely expressed genes. We built a densely sampled
              transcriptomic model of myogenesis, from stem cell quiescence to
              myofiber maturation, and identified rare, transitional states of
              progenitor commitment and fusion that are poorly represented in
              individual datasets. We performed spatial RNA sequencing of mouse
              muscle at three time points after injury and used the integrated
              dataset as a reference to achieve a high-resolution, local
              deconvolution of cell subtypes. We also used the integrated
              dataset to explore ligand-receptor co-expression patterns and
              identify dynamic cell-cell interactions in muscle injury
              response. We provide a public web tool to enable interactive
              exploration and visualization of the data. Our work supports the
              utility of large-scale integration of single-cell transcriptomic
              data as a tool for biological discovery.",
