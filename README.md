# From geospatial to spatial transcriptomics

<!-- badges: start -->

This package brings the glorious tradition of geospatial statistics to spatial omics by wrapping classical geospatial packages such as spdep and adespatial to be used with the SpatialFeatureExperiment class, which extends SpatialExperiment with sf.

## Installation

You can install the development version of Voyager from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pachterlab/Voyager")
```

After I go further with this package, I will submit it to Bioconductor.
