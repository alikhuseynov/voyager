Description: SpatialFeatureExperiment (SFE) is a new S4 class for working
    with spatial single-cell genomics data. The voyager package implements
    basic exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) methods for SFE. This
    first version supports univariate global spatial ESDA methods such as
    Moran's I, permutation testing for Moran's I, and correlograms. The
    Voyager package also implements plotting functions to plot SFE data
    and ESDA results. Multivariate ESDA and univariate local metrics will
    be added in later versions.
