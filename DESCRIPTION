Description: Voyager to SpatialFeatureExperiment (SFE) is just like scater to 
    SingleCellExperiment. While SFE is a new S4 class, Voyager implements basic
    exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) methods for SFE. This first version
    supports univariate global spatial ESDA methods such as Moran's I, 
    permutation testing for Moran's I, and correlograms. Voyager also implements
    plotting functions to plot SFE data and ESDA results. Multivariate ESDA
    and univariate local metrics will be added in later versions.
