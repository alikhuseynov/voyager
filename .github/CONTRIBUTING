First of all, thank you for your contribution! If you would like to do a pull request, to either fix bugs or introduce new features, we strongly encourage you to do the following:

1. If writing new exported functions, please document the function and what each argument means. Examples are encouraged in the function documentation. If you have not documented R functions with `roxygen2` before, please read [Chapter 16 of R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/man.html) to learn how.
2. For new feature or bug fixes, unit tests are strongly encouraged. You can use example data from the `SFEData` package or the internal data in `inst/extdata` for testing, or make you own test datasets. The test dataset should be small and fast to download (if it is not in `inst/extdata`) but should accurately represent the situation being tested for the daily check on Bioconductor, in promptu testing during development, and function examples. If you have not written unit tests before, please read [Chapter 13 of R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-basics.html) to get started.
3. Coding style: 
    - Exported functions: camelCase to be consistent with the Bioconductor ecosystem
    - Internal functions: function names should start with a period (.), and use snake_case
    - Function arguments: snake_case, unless trying to be consistent with a similar function in other packages, especially `scater`, `scran`, `SingleCellExperiment`, `SpatialExperiment`, `sf`, and `terra`.
    - Code identation: 4 spaces, as favored by `biocCheck`
4. Think carefully before introducing dependencies. Read [Chapter 10 of R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies-mindset-background.html) on dependency guidelines.
