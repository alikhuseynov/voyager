\usage{
clusterMoranPlot(
  sfe,
  features,
  BLUSPARAM,
  sample_id = NULL,
  name = "MoranPlot",
  colGeometryName = NULL,
  annotGeometryName = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sfe}{A \code{SpatialFeatureExperiment} object with Moran plot computed
for the feature of interest. If the Moran plot for that feature has not
been computed for that feature in this sample_id, it will be calculated and
stored in \code{rowData}. See \code{\link{calculateMoranPlot}}.}

\item{features}{Features whose Moran plot are to be cluster. Features whose
Moran plots have not been computed will be skipped, with a warning.}

\item{BLUSPARAM}{A \linkS4class{BlusterParam} object specifying the algorithm to use.}

\item{sample_id}{Sample in the SFE object whose cells/spots to use.}

\item{name}{String specifying the name to be used to store the results in
\code{rowData(x)}. If not already present in the name, then the
\code{sample_id} will be appended to the name specified here separated by
an underscore.}

\item{colGeometryName}{Name of colGeometry from which to look for features.}

\item{annotGeometryName}{Name of annotGeometry from which to look for
features.}
}
\value{
A data frame each column of which is a factor for cluster membership
  of each feature. The column names are the features.
}
\description{
The Moran plot plots the value at each location on the x axis, and the
average of the neighbors of each locations on the y axis. Sometimes clusters
can be seen on the Moran plot, indicating different types of neighborhoods.
