\title{Compute variograms}
\usage{
.variogram(x, coords_df, formula = x ~ 1, scale = TRUE, ...)

.variogram_map(x, coords_df, formula = x ~ 1, width, cutoff, scale = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector whose variogram is computed.}

\item{coords_df}{A \code{sf} data frame with the geometry and regressors for
variogram modeling.}

\item{formula}{A formula defining the response vector and (possible)
regressors, in case of absence of regressors, use x ~ 1.}

\item{scale}{Logical, whether to scale \code{x}. Defaults to \code{TRUE} so
the variogram is easier to interpret and is more comparable between
features with different magnitudes when the length scale of spatial
autocorrelation is of interest.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to \code{\link{automap::autofitVariogram}}
such as \code{model} and \code{\link{variogram}} such as \code{alpha} for
anisotropy. Note that \code{gstat} does not fit ansotropic models and you
will get a warning if you specify \code{alpha}. Nevertheless, plotting the
empirical anisotropic variograms and comparing them to the variogram fitted
to the entire dataset can be a useful EDA tool.}

\item{width}{ the width of subsequent distance intervals into which
data point pairs are grouped for semivariance estimates }

\item{cutoff}{ spatial separation distance up to which point pairs
are included in semivariance estimates; as a default, the
length of the diagonal of the box spanning the data is divided by three. }
}
\value{
An \code{autofitVariogram} object.
}
\description{
Wrapper of \code{\link{automap::autofitVariogram}} to facilitate computing
variograms for multiple genes in SFE objects as an EDA tool. These functions
are written to conform to a uniform format for univariate methods to be
called internally. These functions are not exported, but the documentation is
written to show users the extra arguments to use when alling
\code{calculateUnivariate} or \code{runUnivariate}.
